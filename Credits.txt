SFX DONATIONS: Nikko Pakki and Sector03
IMAGES AND OTHER FILES DONATIONS: Sector03

Special thanks to Supercell for the right of letting us do this! Also special thanks to Sector03 who has been super awesome to donate SFX and other image file spreadsheets! Special thanks to Nikko Pakki for a ton of SFX donations as well with a positive attitude! I also got some in game files from a data miner by the name on Imgur of MinileandroCP! Also there was also one other help of getting extra files that I used from with the name of Trgrit on Reddit! Note: they did not put this together as they helped with giving extra materials and names but did not form the folders of the fan kit! Thanks to all who help give me what they could and suggesting!

This is Version 1.2, and will contain no further updates to this folder of files! Meaning if there is another update to the fan kit it will be a brand new folder with everything in this folder and more that will be Uploaded with a different link. The folder you have in front of you will never include more content than it did before!
